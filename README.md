# Week-05-LAB_TASK – Java OOP Lab Assignment

This repository contains the Week 05 lab task for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. The task focuses on the implementation of basic OOP concepts using a Triangle class in Java.

## 📌 Objective

To understand and apply the following OOP principles in Java:

- **Encapsulation**
- **Constructor Overloading**
- **Object Counting with Static Members**
- **Input Validation**
- **Right-Angled Triangle Detection**
- **Custom `toString()` Method**

---

## 🔧 Features

- Accepts three sides of a triangle from the user.
- Validates if the triangle is **mathematically valid** using triangle inequality.
- Detects whether the triangle is:
  - **Equilateral**
  - **Isosceles**
  - **Scalene**
  - **Right-Angled**
- Automatically counts the number of triangle objects created using a static counter.
- Displays triangle type and properties using a custom `toString()` method.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse (recommended IDE)
- Command Line (for compiling & running)
